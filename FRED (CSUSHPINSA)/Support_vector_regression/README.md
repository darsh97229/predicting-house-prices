# Support Vector Regression Prediction
In this code, we use the SVR class from scikit-learn's svm module to define an SVR model. We first standardize the training and test data using scikit-learn's StandardScaler class, which scales the data to have zero mean and unit variance.

We then define a parameter grid with a range of hyperparameters to test using a grid search with 5-fold cross-validation. We specify the SVR estimator as the estimator to use, and set the number of jobs to -1 to use all available CPU cores for parallel computation.

We fit the grid search object to the standardized training data using the fit() method, which will perform a search over the hyperparameter grid and return the best set of hyperparameters found. We print the best hyperparameters to the console.

Next, we fit an SVR model to the standardized training data with the best hyperparameters found by the grid search, and make predictions on the standardized test data using the predict() method. We evaluate the performance of the model using the root
